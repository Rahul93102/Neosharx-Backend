        <h2>A New Era in Artificial Intelligence</h2>
        <p>Today marks a historic milestone in the field of artificial intelligence as OpenAI officially launches GPT-5, the most advanced language model ever created. This breakthrough system demonstrates capabilities that were once thought to be years away.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Features</h3>
        <p>GPT-5 introduces several groundbreaking features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Reasoning:</strong> The model can now solve complex mathematical proofs and multi-step logical problems with near-perfect accuracy.</li>
            <li><strong>True Multimodal Understanding:</strong> Seamless integration of text, images, audio, and video processing in a single unified model.</li>
            <li><strong>Improved Safety:</strong> Advanced alignment techniques ensure the model follows ethical guidelines and refuses harmful requests.</li>
            <li><strong>Extended Context:</strong> Support for up to 1 million tokens, allowing for analysis of entire codebases or books.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Real-World Applications</h3>
        <p>Early testers report remarkable results across various domains:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Medical diagnosis assistance with expert-level accuracy</li>
            <li>Legal document analysis and contract review</li>
            <li>Scientific research acceleration through literature review and hypothesis generation</li>
            <li>Software development with near-autonomous coding capabilities</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Industry Impact</h3>
        <p>"This is not just an incremental improvementâ€”it's a paradigm shift," said Dr. Sarah Chen, AI researcher at MIT. "GPT-5's reasoning capabilities approach human-level performance on many complex tasks."</p>
        
        <p>The model is now available through OpenAI's API, with both research and commercial tiers. Pricing starts at $0.03 per 1K tokens for the standard version.</p>

        content="""
        <h2>The Future of Ethereum</h2>
        <p>At the Ethereum Developer Conference in Singapore, Vitalik Buterin presented a comprehensive roadmap for Ethereum 3.0, outlining the most significant upgrade in the blockchain's history.</p>
        
        <h3>Technical Innovations</h3>
        <p>The upgrade focuses on three key areas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Advanced Sharding:</strong> 64 shard chains processing transactions in parallel</li>
            <li><strong>ZK-SNARKs Integration:</strong> Privacy-preserving transactions built into the protocol</li>
            <li><strong>Quantum Resistance:</strong> Post-quantum cryptography to future-proof the network</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Performance Improvements</h3>
        <p>Current Ethereum can handle approximately 15-30 transactions per second. With Ethereum 3.0, this number is expected to exceed 100,000 TPS while maintaining decentralization.</p>
        
        <h3>Timeline and Migration</h3>
        <p>The rollout is planned in phases over the next 18-24 months. Existing smart contracts will be automatically compatible with the new system.</p>
